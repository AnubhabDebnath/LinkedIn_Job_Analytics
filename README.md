This depository contains the analysis of all the jobs available at linkedin website, it goes through various stages and during the process has encountered a few problems. By tackling those problems I have successfully got a few insights which will help potential job seekers and recruiters to get their best fit. The data scraping part was done in python, cleaning was done using excel and the queries needed were run using mysql again the final dashboard was made on excel.
